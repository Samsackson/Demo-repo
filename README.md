Git is a tool:

It's a free, open-source version control system.
Developers use it to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project.
Git works on your computer, so you donâ€™t need the internet to use it.
GitHub is a platform:

It's a website (and cloud-based service) that uses Git.
GitHub lets you store your Git repositories online, so you can share them, collaborate with others, and keep backups.
It adds features like pull requests, issues tracking, and project management tools.
Key Relationship:
Git is the engine, and GitHub is one of the cars that uses it.
You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub makes teamwork and sharing much easier.
Other platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket also provide similar features to GitHub.
